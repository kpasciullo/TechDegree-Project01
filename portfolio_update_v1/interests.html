          <h2>Coding</h2>
          <p>I could loose track of time everyday just coding away at my laptop. With the world humming away in the background, or my wind chime singing in the breeze time just gets away from me everytime im working on a project.</p>
          <p>I love exploring new things. From online courses, to google and a code editor, creating things from code is such a joyous experience for me!</p>

          <h2>My Backyard Garden</h2>
          <p>In 2020 I tok a step back from the busy pace of life and decided to become a little more self sufficient. This began with digging up a 20 foot by 20 foot in ground garden in our backyard.</p>
          <p>It was a wonderful year of planting, cultivating, and harvesting and it lead to another new and exciting skill... canning.</p>

            <h2>Being Outdoors</h2>
            <p>I live in the beautiful Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, I try to spend as much time as possible outside enjoying it. 
                I love to be at the beach, on one of the amazing trails, or out at camp. I have only lived in British Columbia for 4 years so I am still
                discovering new places all the time!

            <h2>DIY</h2>
            <p>Yes I said it.. I love DIY <br>
                My daughtes and I love creating almost anything together. Some of our favourite DIYs involve sewing,
                macrame, and projects made from things we find in nature. I love finding old treasures at garage sales and 
                fixing them up or reinventing them into something new.
