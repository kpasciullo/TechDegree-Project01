        <h2> BIO</h2>
        <h3>I'm Kayla Pasciullo, a freelance front end Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I am a Treehouse TechDegree student, currently working on building a great portfolio than will help me land my dream job.
          My future plans are to become an expert coder, and to create something that no one else has thought of yet! </p>
       <p>I am an aggressive problem solver who loves a challenge. I am always looking to learn or try something new! 
       </p>
       <p>My current focus is designing and coding functional, responsive landing pages for small or local businesses using <span class="skills">HTML</span> and <span class="skills">CSS</span>. I take pride in writing well designed, efficient code to build websites from concept all the way to completion. 
      </p>

        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
          <h3>When I am not busy coding you can find me enjoying:</h3>
          <p>My Backyard Garden<br>
          I like to step away from the busy pace of life and be a little more self sufficient. Planting, cultivating and harvesting my own food is so satisfying.<p>Being Outdoors<br>
          I live in the beautiful Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, I try to spend as much time as possible outside enjoying it. 
            I love to be at the beach, on one of the amazing trails, or out at camp. 
        </p>
        <p>DIY<br>
        Yes I said it.. I love DIY <br>
            My daughters and I love creating almost anything together. Some of our favourite DIYs involve sewing,
            macrame, and projects made from things we find in nature.
