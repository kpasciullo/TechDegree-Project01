        <p>I am a hard working web developer with a passion for creating unique solutions in the least amount of time.
            I have a passion for creativity. I love things that are unique and different from what people would expect.
          </p>
          <p>I believe being well organized, self motivated, having great time management and work ethics are vital to being an exeptional developer. 
              These skills, along with my 15+ years of working in various customer service jobs have given me the confidence I need to 
              take on new and exciting web development opportunities.

        <p>My passion for coding started back in high school (which was too many years ago to mention)
            I have always loved code, advertising and design. I got to showcase my potential during my employment at The Calgary Sun where 
            where I was responsible for designing and publishing ads for some of the biggest clients we had. After I was laid off durning a major recession I found out I was expecting my first daughter.             
            During my time at home rasing my girls I rediscovered my passion for coding. I enrolled in online courses and took on freelance work to 
            help build my experience and skills. Below are some of the projects I have been recently working on.

              to meet their specific needs. This is a small local business who needed a website to showcase their work.
              This client wanted a simple, easy to navagate site that would attract new clients.
